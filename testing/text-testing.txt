Hi, I’m venki, 45 years old. I’ve been working in cts for quite a while, and I really enjoy 
driving bike. Over the years, I’ve learnedthe value of patience, consistency, and staying 
curious. Outside of work, I love spending time with family. I believe every stage of life 
brings something new to learn, and I enjoy connecting with people and sharing experiences
